        <p>Hi, I'm Wali. My personal career journey started shortly after graduating highschool. I joined the United States Marine Corps were I was able to see places like Japan, South Korea, Romania, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.
           I was also able to present topics of strategy and policy to military grade officers, enlisted Marines & Sailors, foreign partners and civilians.<br><br>I'm a part time student at Central Seattle
           College where I study Information Technology with a focus on Programming and Software Development.<br><br>I'm currently a backend developer specializing in Adobe Experience Manager. I'm a huge fan of the Java
           ecosystem, where developers are supplied mass amounts of tools and libraries to tackle just about anything. Some of my favorite Java technologies are JavaFX, JUnit and Java libraries such as java.net and java.util,
           these libraries provide so many convenience tools out of the box and I think Java does a really good job with that.
           Another tool I'm interested in is Docker. My ultimate goal is to become a well rounded software developer. I've focused on aspects of backend development, but I want to contribute to great products on both the
           front and backend so I'm also focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I enjoy small, clean and simple designs. I try to use this model on backend development as well, applying small, clean and maintainable
           code.<br><br>When I'm not building things or studying, you can find me with my family; spending time with my wife and daughter. We like to take relaxing trips to some of the best natural resources Washington
           State has to offer, like the beautiful Lake Cushman. One of my favorite hobbies is flying drones and experimenting with GPS and Waypoint settings.
